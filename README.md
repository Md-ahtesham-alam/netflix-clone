# Netflix Clone

A simple static Netflix landing page clone built with HTML and CSS. This repository contains a single-page mockup of the Netflix India landing/marketing page used for practice and learning frontend layout and styling.

## Features
- Static responsive layout (hero, trending cards, reasons, FAQ, membership, footer)
- Built with plain `HTML` and `CSS` (no frameworks)
- Images and assets placed in the `img/` and `assets/` folders

## Project Structure
- `index.html` — main HTML file
- `style.css` — stylesheet
- `img/` — images used by the page (background, thumbnails, logo, etc.)
- `assets/` — small SVGs/icons referenced by the page

## How to view locally
You can simply open `index.html` in your browser, or serve it from a small local server.

Quick options (PowerShell):

1) Open file directly (Windows):

```powershell
Start-Process .\index.html
```

2) Run a simple Python HTTP server and open browser:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000; Start-Process "http://localhost:8000"
```

3) Use the VS Code Live Server extension and click "Go Live".
